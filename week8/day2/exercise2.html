When you submit the form with the POST method, the form data will be sent in the body of the HTTP request, rather than appearing in the URL like with the GET method.

To see where the sent data appears, you can use the Network tab in browser's developer tools. 

The form data will be included in the request payload, and you should be able to see the key-value pairs corresponding to the form inputs (Example: "name: John", "message: Hello world").

By inspecting the Network tab, you can examine the request and view the form data that was sent with the POST method.
